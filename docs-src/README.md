## Doc generators

This is a complete quick and dirty solution for
automatic rendering the libraries API.

If you check the code you are going to have nightmares but I didn't
have the time to put it all together correctly and it serves it's purpose.

Contributions and clean up are more than welcome.

We use the json output of `type-doc` and render some stuff with that.
